# eoutpass
A javaservlet based web application to simply process of filling outpass in colleges.
Problem Scenarios:
In engineering college student who live in hostel have to fill outpass before going for outing during holidays and for other purposes.
I have developed a complete e-outpass which saves time of student to manullay fill outpass and the warden of the hostel who confirms the outpass
request.
In this student & warden can fill or confirm outpass using my web application.

My webapplication uses:
SQL
JAVA SERVLET
